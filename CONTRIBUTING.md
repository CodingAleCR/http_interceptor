# Contributing

Contributions are always welcomed and encouraged, we will always give you credit for your work on this section. If you are interested in maintaining the project on a regular basis drop me a line at me@codingale.dev.

I'm starting to use [@all-contributors](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/bot/usage) to recognize everyone's contributions easier. Any feedback you want to provide about the package is encouraged and will be recognized.
