# OpenWeatherApp

Demonstrates how to use the http_interceptor plugin.

## Getting Started

This app implements the usage of the http_interceptor plugin. It uses the OpenWeatherAPI and intercepts the requests done to add the App Id Key and the unit system desired for the response. Notice that this example is for **show purposes only, it is not intended as a full testable implementation**.

### Running the example

In order to run this example locally you will need to replace the API Key in the `credentials.dart`. You can get your own at <https://openweathermap.org/>
